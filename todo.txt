Todo list and misc notes
  Top Priority / WIP:
     - Fix escaping on base64 encoded remote URLs (slash needs to be replaced)
     - Optimize transformation chain as much as possible
        - Prevent duplicate items from being including in transformation chain
     - Setting the background
     - Add more shapes (at least circles)
     - Add support for transparency / alpha in...
       - Color picker and applied to shapes
       - for image or text overlays
     - Warning about instant rendering
     - Warning about URL char length (2083 max for IE, so 2K is good guideline if going to use URL for client-facing stuff)
  If time:
     - Layers / grouping - and Z-index associated
     - shareable templates
     - Looking into saving template as a set of transformations in Cloudinary platform
     - Built in spreadsheet generator that lets you use macros
      - Undo button / CTRL+Z combo
      - Copy / clone button

Important notes to self:
   - canvas.renderAll() needs to be called BEFORE .bringToFront() and changing index
