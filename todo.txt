Todo list and misc notes
  Top Priority / WIP:
     - Fix escaping on base64 encoded remote URLs (slash needs to be replaced)
     - Optimize transformation chain as much as possible
        - Prevent duplicate items from being including in transformation chain
     - Setting the background
     - Add support for transparency / alpha in...
       - Color picker and applied to shapes
       - for image or text overlays
     - Warning about URL char length (2083 max for IE, so 2K is good guideline if going to use URL for client-facing stuff)
     - Scaling slider
        - Would be used so you don't have to make the editor the exact same size as you want the output to be - example, you could set editor at 300x300 and scale at 2x to get a 600x600 output
  If time:
     - Layers / grouping - and Z-index associated
     - shareable templates
     - Looking into saving template as a set of transformations in Cloudinary platform
     - Built in spreadsheet generator that lets you use macros
     - Undo button / CTRL+Z combo
     - Copy / clone button
     - DPad for moving objects by 1 pixel nudges, click and hold to move rapidly

Important notes to self:
   - canvas.renderAll() needs to be called BEFORE .bringToFront() and changing index
