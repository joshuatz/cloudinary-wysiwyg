Todo list and misc notes
  Top Priority / WIP:
     - Optimize transformation chain:
         - Looks like the final crop dimensions keep getting re-applied!
     - Setting the background
     - Add more shapes (at least circles)
     - Add support for transparency / alpha in...
       - Color picker and applied to shapes
       - for image or text overlays
     - Warning about instant rendering
     - Warning about URL char length (2083 max for IE, so 2K is good guideline if going to use URL for client-facing stuff)
  If time:
     - Layers / grouping - and Z-index associated
     - shareable templates
     - Panel that shows stats (# of transformations, char length of URL, etc.) - as you edit
     - Looking into saving template as a set of transformations in Cloudinary platform
     - Built in spreadsheet generator that lets you use macros

Important notes to self:
   - canvas.renderAll() needs to be called BEFORE .bringToFront() and changing index
